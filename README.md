# blackjack

Simple implementation of the [guardian coding exercise 21s](https://github.com/guardian/coding-exercises/tree/main/21s) in Elm. 

It can illustrate how one can use elm to make something other than front-end work.

## build and run

You can build and run the project like this: 

```bash
elm make src/Blackjack2.elm --output src/blackjack.js && node src/index.js
```
